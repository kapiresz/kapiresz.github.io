    During my time at NBS I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Photography Society* taking on the role of *President*. Moreover, I have lead teams in Business Challenges such as *UBC Worldwide by IBM*, volunteered with the *International Team* and have been presented with different awards such as the *Acceler8 Gold*.
